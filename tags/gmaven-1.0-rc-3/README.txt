Building
========

Simply run Maven ;-)

    mvn install


Integration Testing
===================

To invoke integration tests using the SHITTY plugin you need to:

    mvn -Dit


Site Generation
===============

You need to perform a full build first, before site generation will function correctly:

    mvn install site

To generate the full site locally for review:

    mvn install site-deploy -DstageDistributionUrl=file:`pwd`/dist

NOTE: Looks like something is whacky somewhere, and you will *need* to
      run the site goals with the install goal for the gmaven-examples
      site to generate correctly.

Release Muck
============

First sanity check:

    mvn -Drelease release:prepare -DdryRun | tee release-prepare-dry.log

If all looks happy, first clean up:

    mvn release:clean
    rm *.log

And then:

    mvn -Drelease release:prepare | tee release-prepare.log
    mvn -Drelease release:perform | tee release-perform.log

NOTE: It appears that release:prepare needs -Dusername=xxx and -Dpassword=xxx to
      work correctly... :-(

The generated website is not deployed as part of the release process ATM, so
keep the release tree around and run site build from there.
